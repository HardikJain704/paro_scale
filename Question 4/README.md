The issue in the previous code was that the producer and consumer functions were defined after their usage in the code. C requires function declarations or prototypes to be present before their usage in the code.

By adding the forward declarations for the add_data, remove_data, producer, and consumer functions at the beginning of the code, we ensure that these functions are declared before they are used. This resolves the error you encountered, which was caused by the missing function declarations.
